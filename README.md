Global Terrorism Data Analysis Project
     #ProjectOverview
This project leverages data mining and big data analytics techniques to analyze global terrorism data. By exploring patterns, trends, and geographical distributions of terrorist incidents, the project provides actionable insights into high-risk regions, attack types, and success rates. The goal is to demonstrate data analysis, visualization, and machine learning expertise while addressing a socially significant issue.

#KeyFeatures

#DataPreprocessing: Cleaned and normalized raw data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
#ExploratoryDataAnalysis: Visualized trends in terrorist activities by region, attack type, success rate, and other factors using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
#ClusteringAnalysis: Applied K-Means clustering to group incidents based on geographical locations (latitude and longitude).
#GeographicalHeatmap: Created an interactive heatmap using Plotly to visualize terrorism intensity across regions with a color scale (green for low intensity, red for high intensity).
#PredictiveModeling: Built machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict the success of terrorist attacks based on features like attack type and suicide involvement.

#ToolsAndTechnologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
Visualization Tools: Plotly Express, Matplotlib
Database Management: PostgreSQL (optional for storing processed data)

##StepsToReproduce
#Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-terrorism-analysis.git
cd global-terrorism-analysis

#Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place the dataset (global_terrorism.csv) in the data/ directory.

#Run the preprocessing script to clean the data:
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py

#Perform clustering analysis:
python scripts/clustering_analysis.py

#Generate geographical heatmaps using Plotly.


#KeyInsights
Regions with the highest frequency of terrorist incidents include South Asia and the Middle East.
Bombings/Explosions are the most common type of attack globally.
Success rates of attacks vary significantly based on attack type and target.

#FutureWork
Expand predictive modeling to include more features for better accuracy.
Integrate real-time data streams for live terrorism monitoring.
Develop an interactive dashboard for better visualization of results.
